## Goals:
Create a basic button component

[Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/939bW74C3TLW5VAzK23uox/moonstone-components?node-id=70%3A287)

## Specifications:
A disabled button cannot be clickable.

Text label should use component typography, with variant "button"

We need design specs for each props and states (hover, focus, disables; active ...)

Only icons buttons should have an aria-label for accessibility reasons
