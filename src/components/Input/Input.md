The Input component is built in two sizes. It also uses the Icon token as a leading icon which indicates the purpose of the Input.

## Search Variant
To use the search variant of the Input, use `variant="search"` for the Input.
This displays the Search/magnifying glass icon at the beginning of the Input.

Also, ensure that an `onClear` callback is provided which will cause the Cancel icon to appear at the end of the input.
The purpose of the `onClear` prop is to provide a callback which will clear the text in the Input.
